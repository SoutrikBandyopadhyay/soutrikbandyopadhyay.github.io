Education
======

* Ph.D. in Control Theory, [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/), CGPA - 10/10 ,2025 (expected)

* Dual Degree B.Tech. - M.Tech. in Electrical Engineering, [IIEST Shibpur](https://www.iiests.ac.in/), CGPA - 9.46/10 ,2020


Research experience
======
* Winter 2017: Research Assistant
  * IIEST Shibpur
  * Supervisor: Prof. Aparajita Sengupta, Department of Electrical Engineering
  * Applied Reinforcement Learning Control Algorithms to control a Hardware Continuum Robot (Soft Robot) via MATLAB. The original system was a complex system owing to its High DoF. My controller optimally controlled the system with better performance than the methods in the literature.

* Summer 2018: Research Assistant
  * Jadavpur University
  * Supervisor: Prof. Ranjit Kumar Barai, Department of Electrical Engineering
  * Fabricated an Intelligent Landmark Recognition Mobile Robot with all associated driver circuits along-with controller software written on Raspberry Pi
  * Implemented a Fuzzy-Proportional Integral Controller from scratch in Python for the Raspberry Pi Platform to detect and navigate towards objects of interest. The resulting controller effectively migrated towards placards placed in a room and showed robust performance with respect to camera noise.
