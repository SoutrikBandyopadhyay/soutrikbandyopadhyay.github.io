I am in search of the way
Meandering paths lead me here today
I am driving at the speed of sound
Darkness in the air around

Ages passed in this tunnel now
Will I see the end of it? Tell me how?
Bumps strewed across the path ahead
Gloom dancing to the silence of the dead

Herald foretold an end to the tunnel soon
Said contentment lay ahead of the doom
With hope in the heart and fists clenched
I set forth in the rain of sorrow — drenched

Light at the end of the tunnel seems far today
Got in this place only trepidation and dismay
Shattered lay many hopes and dreams
Endless blood and countless screams

Oh, I see a glare ahead!
For me does the beloved light await?
Sacrifices we made a while ago
Will they suffice to take me Home?

Alas! The joy ephemeral
The glint of a cracked mirror
Gave hope only to take it away
Tired, it’s been a long day

I still drive my car today
Still wet from that rainy day
Hope I have still
Never deterred, never will
