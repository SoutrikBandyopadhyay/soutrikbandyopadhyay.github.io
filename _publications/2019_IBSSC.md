excerpt: 'Use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in designing
adaptive self-tuning PID controllers is a relatively new horizon of
research with Q-learning and its variants being the predominant
algorithms found in the literature. However, the possibility of
using an interesting alternative algorithm i.e. Advantage Actor
Critic (A2C) in the above context is relatively unexplored.
In the present study, Deep Q Networks (DQN) and A2C
approaches have been employed to design self-tuning PID
controllers. Comparative performance analysis of both the
controllers was undertaken in a simulation environment on a
servo position control system, with various static and dynamic
control objectives, keeping a conventional PID controller as
a baseline. A2C based Adaptive PID Controller(A2CAPID) is
more promising in trajectory tracking problems whereas DQN
based Adaptive PID Controller(DQNAPID) is rather suitable
for systems with relatively large plant parameter variations.'
